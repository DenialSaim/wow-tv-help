Like any modern TV and internet provider, WOW TV understands that customers need quick, efficient support. Whether you're trying to upgrade your plan, report an outage, or cancel a service, reaching WOW TV customer service can feel like a confusing maze—unless you know the best way to go about it.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to contact WOW TV customer service, what to expect, and some helpful tips for resolving your issues quickly and smoothly. If you're frustrated or simply curious about how to get better support, this article is your roadmap.

How Do I Contact WOW TV Customer Service?

The most direct way to get help is by calling WOW TV customer service through their dedicated support line. Their phone support is typically available during business hours and can assist with anything from billing concerns to internet or TV troubleshooting.

If you’re not a fan of phone calls or you need help outside of regular hours, WOW TV also provides live chat on their official website. This is a great option for quicker fixes or smaller issues like resetting your password or checking service availability in your area.

Email support is also available, although responses may take longer. This method is ideal for non-urgent issues or if you need to attach documents or screenshots to explain your situation better.

Online Account Access for Self-Service

One of the most underused tools available to customers is the WOW TV online account portal. By logging into your account, you can view your billing history, make payments, restart your equipment, or even schedule technician visits without having to speak to a representative.

This self-service option is perfect for tech-savvy users who want to resolve issues without waiting on hold or chatting online.

When Should You Contact WOW TV Customer Service?

It’s important to recognize when an issue can be resolved through self-service and when it’s time to contact a representative. Common reasons to reach out include:

Unexpected charges on your bill

Prolonged service outages

Equipment malfunctions or installation problems

Upgrading or downgrading your plan

Cancelling or moving your service to a new address

WOW TV customer service is trained to handle all of these scenarios and more. The key is to be clear and concise about your issue so they can assist you efficiently.

Tips for a Better Customer Service Experience

Before contacting WOW TV customer service, there are a few things you can do to make the process smoother. First, gather all relevant information such as your account number, recent bills, or any error messages you may have received.

Be patient but assertive. If the first representative can’t solve your problem, don’t hesitate to ask to speak to a supervisor. Taking notes during the call or chat can also help if you need to follow up later.

It’s also a good idea to check WOW TV’s social media pages. Often, they will post updates about outages or other known issues, saving you time and effort.

Using the WOW TV Mobile App

WOW TV also offers a mobile app that lets you manage your services on the go. Through the app, you can make payments, view usage, and even reset your equipment with just a few taps. This is another valuable alternative to contacting customer service, especially for quick tasks.

What to Do If You're Not Satisfied

If you feel your issue hasn’t been resolved to your satisfaction, you have options. You can file a complaint through the Better Business Bureau or your local consumer protection agency. Before doing so, be sure you’ve tried all available WOW TV customer service channels and documented your attempts to resolve the issue.
